Ground Obstacle Height
This is the maximum height, in units, an object can be while still allowing the player to walk over it.
	Crouched: 18
	Standing: 18

Overhead Obstacle Height
This is the minimum distance, in units, that can be between the ground and an object while still allowing the player to pass underneath.
	Crouched: 37
	Standing: 73
	Left 4 Dead Crouched: 56
	Counter-Strike Source Crouched: 50
	Counter-Strike Source Standing: 63
	CS:GO Crouched: 55
	CS:GO Standing: 73

Minimum Path Size
This is the minimum size, in units, that can be between two objects while still allowing the player to pass between them.
	Width: 33 (Between collision surfaces oriented along the x or y axis.)
	Width: 46 (Walls rotated 45 degrees to grid.)
	Width: 65 (On-axis width between walls skewed to 45 degrees relative to grid.)
	Height: 37

Gradient
This is the maximum slope angle, in degrees from the horizontal, that the player can scale. Anything steeper than this is un-climbable.
	Gradient: 45Â°
