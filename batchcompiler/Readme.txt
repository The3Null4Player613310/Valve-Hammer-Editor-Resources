Q.
  When I open an old preset file I get the following error message:
  "Error: The data at the root level is invalid. Line 1, position 1."

A.
  Batch Compiler v3.X.X is not backwards compatible with Batch Compiler
  v2.X.X. This means that old preset files will not work and you will
  have to recreate them.


Q.
  How can I convert a preset I've saved using one specification file to
  a preset of another specification file?

A.
  This can be accomplished by importing the preset. To do this:

    1. From the 'Specifications' menu select the specification file you
       would like to convert the preset to.
    2. From the 'File' menu select 'Import Preset'.
    3. Browse to and open the preset you would like to convert from.
